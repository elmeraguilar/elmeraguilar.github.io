# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, part 1

    This lab was incredibly difficult for me to accomplish with my partner, although I believed thats why it deserved a spot in one of my favorite labs yet. My partner and I went through a generous amount of errors and debugging in each TO-DO, although I suprisingly learned more than I expected througout each error. I felt like it was easier to understand conditional statements after lab 7, since I have always had trouble within figuring out how to implement conditionals with more complicated instructions, unlike a simple, "..find when x is less than y". Even if this lab was done later in the semester, I believed it was one of my favorites because of how much more I learned from just a couple TO-DO's which most likely helped me in later labs. 

* Lab 4, part 1

    Math with code always intimidated me, as this was my first taste in implementing instructions on calculating values, INTO programming. I did have a hard time understanding the TODO instructions since I mixed up variables with others. Although my partner made sure to explain it early into the lab, so it was much more easier to interpret the directions later throughout the lab, especially into part-2. Math conditionals were also something I didn't touch until this lab, I've only used "+" with certain labs before but it was not about anything this thorough with double variables. 

* Lab 1, part 1

    It is obvious that this lab was the easiest of them all, it was just a couple lines that were most familiar with anyone with minimal coding experience, at least that's what I think now. I remember doing this lab on my second week into this semester, as it was my first time really coding. Programming with javascript in highschool was introduced using building blocks. Here, I felt more hands on with jumping straight in into learning the basics on the exact compiler we'll be using for the rest of the year. I felt more in tune with intaking the experience, and to prove it, moving on was definitely not easy.
